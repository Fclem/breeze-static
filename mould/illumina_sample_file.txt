It passes many of the materials to lysosomes for degradation [goid 5768] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process by which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 9245787] [evidence TAS]"	"Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with zinc (Zn) ions [goid 8270] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any metal ion [goid 46872] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with zinc (Zn) ions [goid 8270] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any metal ion [goid 46872] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with zinc (Zn) ions [goid 8270] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any metal ion [goid 46872] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with zinc (Zn) ions [goid 8270] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any metal ion [goid 46872] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with zinc (Zn) ions [goid 8270] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any metal ion [goid 46872] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [pmid 9245787] [evidence TAS]; Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [pmid 16189514] [evidence IPI]; Interacting selectively with zinc (Zn) ions [goid 8270] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with any metal ion [goid 46872] [evidence IEA]"	KIAA0059; FLJ14564; MGC1224; LIMATIN; LIMAB1; DKFZp781D0148; ABLIM	KIAA0059; FLJ14564; MGC1224; LIMATIN; LIMAB1; DKFZp781D0148; ABLIMABLIM1	3610315	115.4	115.4	115.4	1	NaN	4.343	20	0.17532	111.9	111.9	111.9	1	NaN	3.314	25	0.25844	108.4	108.4	108.4	1	NaN	3.548	21	0.47403	117.8	117.8	117.8	1	NaN	3.062	26	0.1013	109.7	109.7	109.7	1	NaN	3.866	24	0.41169	119.5	119.5	119.5	1	NaN	3.08	25	0.14026	106	106	106	1	NaN	2.937	26	0.47143	107.2	107.2	107.2	1	NaN	3.658	27	0.72597	114.6	114.6	114.6	1	NaN	2.563	30	0.36364	121.4	121.4	121.4	1	NaN	3.816	24	0.08961	109.2	109.2	109.2	1	NaN	4.165	21	0.28831	116.9	116.9	116.9	1	NaN	4.364	31	0.14416	Homo sapiens	RefSeq	NM_006720.3	ILMN_21737	ABLIM1	NM_006720.3	NM_006720.3		3983	51173716	NM_006720.3	ABLIM1	NP_006711.3	ILMN_1731610	3610315	I	141	AGTCTGTCGGGCTGAGGTCTGGCATCTACAAAGCCTCTTGGCCGTGTTCT	10	-	116286495-116286544	10q25.3a	"Homo sapiens actin binding LIM protein 1 (ABLIM1), transcript variant 4, mRNA."

In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

"The space external to the outermost structure of a cell. For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 15454088] [evidence IDA]; The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment.

As the nerve fiber approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic nerve ending, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the nerve ending is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic nerve ending secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

"A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.
